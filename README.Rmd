This package contains an ElasticNet model which can use RNA-Seq data to predict immune phenotypes of the samples.

**Warning**: RNA-Seq expression values can be strongly affected by both the
experimental protocol and the data processing. Before running the prediction
make sure that your data is comparable to data used in the
training dataset. A simple way to check is to compare your data to
`data("cd8ip_simulated_counts")`.
